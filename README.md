--> above is the image reprsesenting a simple todo list website hosted in the firebase with featutes like 
  1)logging into the page if user exist or else registering 
    1a)also logging the page via google popup authentication.
  2)adding the tasks and target date to complete
  3)toggling the tasks on completion byb clickig on the list item and the thing is the list item turns into green for completing the task,which i find   
      somewhat cool thing to add.
  4)If the task Overdues the target date ,the list item border turn into red indicating that you overdued the task.
  5)The data of the every individual stores into the firestore database,which is responsible for saving your data even after logging out of the website.
  6)You can get logout and login some other time with the same credentials and you are ready to visible your to do tasks.
